              What is Chess?
             </h1>
           <article> 
            Chess is a two-player, turn-based, strategic board game played on a checkered board with 64 squares.<br>
             The objective is to checkmate the opponent's king, meaning it's attacked and has no escape.<br>
              Each player controls 16 pieces of contrasting colors (typically black and white), with each piece having unique movement rules.<br>
               The game involves deep strategic thinking and tactical skill, with no element of luck involved.<br>

            <h1>HOW TO PLAY. </h1>
            <P> Each of the 6 different kinds of pieces moves differently. Pieces cannot move through other pieces (though the knight can jump over other pieces), and can never move onto a square with one of their own pieces. However, they can be moved to take the place of an opponent's piece which is then captured. Pieces are generally moved into positions where they can capture other pieces (by landing on their square and then replacing them), defend their own pieces in case of capture, or control important squares in the game.

How to Move the King in Chess
The king is the most important piece, but is one of the weakest. The king can only move one square in any direction - up, down, to the sides, and diagonally.



The king may never move himself into check (where he could be captured). When the king is attacked by another piece this is called "check".

How To Move The Queen In Chess
The queen is the most powerful piece. She can move in any one straight direction - forward, backward, sideways, or diagonally - as far as possible as long as she does not move through any of her own pieces.



And, like with all pieces, if the queen captures an opponent's piece her move is over. Notice how the white queen captures the black queen and then the black king is forced to move.

How To Move The Rook In Chess
The rook may move as far as it wants, but only forward, backward, and to the sides.



The rooks are particularly powerful pieces when they are protecting each other and working together!

How To Move The Bishop In Chess
The bishop may move as far as it wants, but only diagonally. Each bishop starts on one color (light or dark) and must always stay on that color.



Bishops work well together because they cover up each other's weaknesses.

How To Move The Knight In Chess
Knights move in a very different way from the other pieces – going two squares in one direction, and then one more move at a 90-degree angle, just like the shape of an “L”.



Knights are also the only pieces that can move over other pieces.

How To Move The Pawn In Chess
Pawns are unusual because they move and capture in different ways: they move forward but capture diagonally. Pawns can only move forward one square at a time, except for their very first move where they can move forward two squares.



Pawns can only capture one square diagonally in front of them. They can never move or capture backward. If there is another piece directly in front of a pawn he cannot move past or capture that piece.

       <h1> My favourite Checkmates </h1>
       <h2> 
        THE FRIED LIVER ATTACK.
       </h2>
       <p> 
        The Fried Liver attack is not really a checkmate.<br> Instead it is more like a way you sacrifice your Knight  to capture their  Queen.
