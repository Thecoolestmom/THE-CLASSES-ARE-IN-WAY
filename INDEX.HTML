                facts about the door
             </h2>
             <p> 1. Symbolic & Cultural Significance:
Doors often carry symbolic weight in different cultures, representing beginnings, endings, and opportunities. For example, opening doors and windows at the New Year is a tradition to welcome the new year and let go of the old.
2. Evolution of Design:
The earliest "doors" were likely simple rocks blocking entrances, but have since evolved into sophisticated structures. Modern doors can be made of diverse materials and use various mechanisms, such as hinges, rollers, or even smart technology for automated access. 
3. Diverse Functionality:
Beyond basic security and access control, doors can serve multiple functions. They can also provide insulation, regulate airflow, and enhance natural light, with modern designs like folding doors contributing to energy efficiency. </p>
