            Sans appears as a relatively short and paunchy skeleton, with mitten-like hands. He has white dots for pupils in his black eye sockets that disappear when he is serious or angered. When Sans uses telekinesis, his left eye flashes light blue and yellow, the colors for patience and justice, and his right pupil vanishes. No matter the mood Sans is in, he is always seen with a wide, toothy-grin on his face. His clothes consists of a blue hoodie with a gray hood, a white t-shirt underneath, black shorts with white stripes on the sides, and a pair of slippers.
