            c00lkidd is a naturally mischievous 10-year-old who was abandoned at birth and left on the doorstep of the extremely infamous former hacker 007n7 as a so-called pill baby. Although 007n7 was mostly finished with hacking at the time and was reluctant to raise a child, he ultimately took c00lkidd in and raised him, becoming his adoptive father.[1]

        </p>
        <p>
            As part of his retirement from hacking, 007n7 created a weaker version of his c00lgui. However, c00lkidd eventually discovered the original version of the c00lgui, which was far more powerful and had previously been used by 007n7 to terrorize Robloxia.[1]
        </p>
        <p>
            With access to the original c00lgui and at just 10-years-old, c00lkidd formed an exploiting group known as "team c00lkidd" and became its leader. Under his leadership, the group reached a level of chaos comparable to 007n7's prime, spreading widespread disruption, rebellion, and destruction across Robloxia. They targeted multiple games, including Work at a Pizza Place and Natural Disaster Survival, while also growing the group's following. Although the group generated significant negativity among the public, many were also inspired and chose to join. Members handled the direct actions, while c00lkidd focused on operating the GUI.[1]
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite having retired from hacking, 007n7 was a highly negligent parent. He discovered his son using the original c00lgui multiple times but chose only to hide it each time rather than completely destroy it. This enabled c00lkidd to repeatedly retrieve the GUI and continue causing chaos.[1] Following the attack on Work at a Pizza Place, which caused severe trauma to a prominent employee known as Elliot, who would later end up in FORSAKEN, both c00lkidd and 007n7 were blacklisted from the establishment.

            In FORSAKEN lore, Slasher is a bacon-haired prisoner of war from the Roblox action-animated war film The Last Guest by ObliviousHD. After being captured, he was sent to Area 51 and subjected to brutal, inhumane experiments. During this time, he was exposed to the Necrobloxicon, a cursed book whose mysterious voice convinced him it was his mother. He later escaped alongside Jeff The Killer and Slenderman, continuing to commit acts of violence under the book's influence.
        </p>
        <p>
            Slasher, while in possession of the book, began hearing a motherly voice speaking to him from within it, which he believed to be his own mother. In reality, the book has no true control over him; it mimics her voice to tighten its hold, manipulating him like a puppet.[4] Under its influence, he gradually lost his sense of reality and adopted the violent persona he is known for today.

            The exact circumstances of how Slasher arrived in FORSAKEN remain unknown. Though, he holds a deep vendetta against Guest 1337, as he was the Last Guest who joined the Roblox Army to battle Slasher's own kind, the Bacon Hairs. This explains why the Slasher has a custom kill animation when killing Guest 1337, and an official lore image on the right depicts him going against the Guest in the Forsaken realm, while The Spectre watches from the sky.
