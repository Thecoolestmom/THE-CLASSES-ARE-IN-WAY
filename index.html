                depend on their weight. As a pet grows older, its weight increases, making its abilities more efficient â€” such as reducing cooldowns or increasing passives. Mega Pets have better stats even at level 1, except for certain pets like the Triceratops, which have constant stats. As of the Prehistoric Event, players can increase their pet weight during hatching by using Brontosaurus.Players can also increase their pet age during hatching by using Ostrich. Players can also increase shop-bought pet weight by using the Barn owl.
