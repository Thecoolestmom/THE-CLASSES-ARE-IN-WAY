            A Black Flash in Jujutsu Kaisen is a special attack where the user's cursed energy flashes black, creating a distortion in space that multiplies the attack's power by \(2.5^{2}\), or \(6.25\). It occurs when a physical blow imbues a cursed energy strike within one-millionth of a second of impact, a feat requiring immense concentration and an intense mental state. Achieving a Black Flash allows the user to enter a "flow state" where manipulating cursed energy becomes instinctual and they can operate at their peak potential.

            In FORSAKEN lore, c00lkidd is the 10-year-old adopted son of 007n7, who is a Survivor in Forsaken. 007n7 adopted him after he was left at his door. After receiving the c00lgui from his adopted father—a life-changing mistake—he unleashed chaos throughout Roblox, especially in Work at a Pizza Place, then disappeared.
